Elemental bending a la Avatar: The Last Airbender. Most people cannot bend, those that can usually only bend one element; you are a rare individual, called a Starborn, who can learn to master all 4 elements, though you start with only one.

The combat is turn-based in the style of Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, and has a heavy focus on martial arts, including grappling, and the elemental synergy between the 4 natural elements.

The setting is in Bronze Age Rome in the Coliseum, and you are a gladiator fighting in a series of tournaments. Each character's progression is based not on their gear, but on their accumulation of in-game techniques and out-of-game skill as a player.



STORY
	You are a savant with a gift for combat tactics and judging your opponent's abilities. You are a slave.
	
	Captive and forced to compete in a series of increasingly brutal gladatorial challenges, you fight to survive.
	
	While fighting your way up the ranks in the Coliseum, you are ambushed by a rival team outside of the ring. In this fight, there are no rules, and the loser will die.
	
	Surviving to the top ranks, you begin your career as a top-tier entertainer, fighting in several ridiculous scenarios for the amusement of the rich onlookers. 
	
	Your career is cut short when a rich businessman begins interfering and making the challenges very difficult. This comes to a head with a direct confrontation with the businessman outside of the ring.
	
	This has the feel of a scripted loss, because it's very difficult, and he says that if you fight back, he will end you (and he will).
	
	If you take the loss, he captures you and brings you far away to another land. This is the Bad Ending.
	
	If you defeat him in combat, you are ended by his partners, but you go on to become a Legend of the Coliseum, and a martyr for the rights of slaves, leading to a revolution. This is the Good Ending.
	
	
	
MAX TECHS per level: 10
	max combat techs: 9
	1-3 passive techs per level
	
	
STANCE
	Depending on which element the technique you last used was, you gain the benefits and drawbacks of that stance:
		Fire
			Hit +5%
			Water techniques do +1 damage to you
		Earth
			Short EVA +5%
			Fire techniques do +1 damage to you
		Air
			SPD +1
			Earth techniques do +1 damage to you
		Water
			Wide EVA +5%
			Air techniques do +1 damage to you




You can gain Boons which allow you to do something during combat that would normally be illegal (acquiring a temporary weapon, getting a temporary helper combatant, taking a break and healing, using some drugs or eating food (using an item basically), getting a free hit on the enemy, getting to reset your positions to the start of the fight, etc.). These are effectively one-time use "items" that you can call on at any point during the battle. You gain these by fulfilling certain randomized requirements during battles.



Combat plays out like this.
	Both sides select everything they want to do for the round.
	Then the round executes, and is resolved. The Priority stat of techniques, and the speed of the combatants will be factored into determining which moves are executed in which order. Each technique is resolved one after another in a queue. Boons have the highest priority of all possible actions.
	---- Attacks can be blocked with good timing, like Paper Mario. -----
								(This could be problematic)
	The next round begins.
	
	


	Actions you can take on your turn:
		
		Attack - 1 NRG
			Priority = 0
			Costs 0 SP
			50% to-hit
			1 damage
			No element associated (neutral)
			
		Technique
			Open list of known techs and choose one to use
	
		Study - 1 NRG
			Priority = 0
			Using your brilliant deductive reasoning, you gain vital knowledge about your opponent from their fighting style, mannerisms, their posture, accent, hygiene, etc. Anything to get an edge.
			Learn some of your opponent's stats and techniques. You can learn:
				HP and HP max
				SP and SP max
				Accuracy
				Evasion
				Speed
				Damage
				Defense
			You cannot learn what Techniques they use by Studying during battle, the only way to know is to hear about it or see them perform the tech.
			IDEA: The first time you use this action in a battle or when you still have stats to learn, you learn the above stats. After you've learned them, subsequent uses of the Study action cost 0 NRG and allow you to review the stats of your opponent, since not all of these stats are going to be shown on the screen at all times, right?
			
		Claim Boon - 1 NRG
			Priority = 3
		
		Retrieve Weapon (if you are disarmed) - 1 NRG
			Priority = -2
			Chance to succeed: 50 + (Skill*2)% if Combat is Short, 100% if Wide.
			
		Rest - 3 NRG
			Priority = -9
			Restore 3 SP; if you are attacked during this turn, restore only 1 SP.
			
		Suspend (save game)
			Priority = 9
			Saves current game, Brings you to main menu
		
		Forfeit
			Priority = 3
			Asks if you're sure, then forfeits the match -- you lose gold for the fight as with failure, and you do not level up. This is a minor setback but it's far better than being defeated, because if you are defeated, you lose gold, fall back a level, AND receive a permanent injury. You do not lose known skills, skill points, or stats, except for those caused by the injury.
			Optionally, load game but you are encouraged to attempt to continue the game after such setbacks (although in harder difficulty settings this may not be feasible)
			Achievements? Achievement for beating game with 0 losses. One for beating game with >=5 losses.
		
		
	Knowledge you have of your opponent before the fight:
		Name
		Favored weapon
		Possibly some or all of the techniques that they use by name, but more generally...
		Which styles of combat they typically use 
			e.g. "they run Short and use aggressive Fire and Water tech" or "they fight Wide using defensive Air techniques"
		If you did research on your opponent before the fight, you may learn one or more of your opponent's stats:
				HP and HP max
				SP and SP max
				Accuracy
				Evasion
				Defense
				Damage
				Speed
			- Once you learn this information from your opponent you never lose it and can see it update during the fight. 
			- You can learn info by researching before a fight just by asking people about the combatant. Doing so may require you to give something in return, however.
				You can give info you learn to other combatants to buy more info, but doing so may make them stronger and make them into tougher combatants if you have to fight them in the ring eventually.
			- Another way to learn info about a combatant is to watch them fight. This can be a great way to see their strategy in action before having to face it yourself. This gives you all the info about your opponent.
		
	Knowledge you have of your opponent at start of fight:
		Weapon equipped (& whether it's their favored weapon)
		Everything that you knew before the fight (listed above)
		
	Knowledge you gain during the fight:
		Studying can teach you everything about the opponent with just 2 NRG.
		But if you just fight without Studying you will still gain knowledge.
			When you strike your opponent, you automatically learn how much HP, Defense and Evasion they have.
			When you are struck by your opponent, you learn their SP, Accuracy, Damage, and Speed, as well as the 
			
		



There are two modes of combat: Short (grappling), and Wide (non-grappling combat)

Techniques fall under one of two of the above categories; some techniques can be used in either mode of combat, but most can only be used in their respective category.


Elemental combat

Earth
Water
Fire
Air

Fire is harmed by Water, strenthed by Air, defeats Earth
Air is harmed by Earth, strengthed by Fire, defeats Water
Water is harmed by Air, strengthed by Earth, defeats Fire
Earth is harmed by Fire, strengthed by Water, defeats Air


Fire -> Earth -> Air -> Water -> (Fire)

	You can gain one (1) extra damage per turn from exploiting elemental weaknesses.
		Your first attack of the turn that has elemental advantage gains +1 Dmg and +10 to-hit. (If you miss this attack, you've lost this advantage)
			The implications of this are that you may decide, for example, to use an elemental advantage with your first move of the turn, and then switch to using a different element for a subsequent move. This will change your most recently used element, hence changing your style and your elemental weakness potentially multiple times per turn in order to confuse your opponent.
		To get elemental advantage, use an attack technique with the element that defeats the element your opponent used in their last move. This may require strategic planning to figure out what your opponent might do, if your opponent uses multiple elements.
	

Status effects:

	Fire techniques can cause _Burning_ effect.
		Opponent takes 1 (piercing) dmg per turn for the duration
		
	Earth techniques can cause _Stunned_ effect.
		25% chance that any given action will fail for the duration. 
		
	Air techniques can cause _Hypoxia_ (Hypoxic) effect.
		Opponent has -10 to HIT for the duration
		Opponent has -10 to EVA for the duration
		
	Water techniques can cause _Softened_ effect.
		Opponent has -1 to DFN for the duration
		Opponent has -1 to SPD for the duration
	
	The duration does not count down like a typical turn counter. Instead, each action attempted reduces the duration for all statuses by 1, so taking multiple actions per turn can reduce the duration of the effect significantly compared to taking a single action per turn.
		
	Statuses are not mutually exclusive. You can be Cold and Burning at the same time (that would suck). If a status is applied to a target that already is affected by that status, the status durations stack. There is no limit to how high the duration stack can get.
	
	It is also possible, although rare, for an element to cause a status effect outside its normal effects for that element. For instance:
		Frostbite - Water: Burn
		Drill - Earth: Soften
		Compression Bomb - Air: Stun
		Slow Burn - Fire: Hypoxia

Progression
	You gain random Boon(s) after each battle for fulfilling the randomized Boon requirements.
	You start at Level 1. Level is the same thing as the in-game tracker for your status as a fighter.
	Leveling up is done after every victory. You can choose to increase one of the following stats:
		Body + 1
		Spirit + 1
		Skill + 1
	You also get +1 Tech point that you can use to buy a new technique.
		Techniques cost the amount of Tech points equal to the Level of the technique.
	* At level 5, you can choose an extra favorite weapon, gain access to Level 2 techniques, and gain access to a new chosen Element and its tech tree.
		The extra favorite weapon grants you the same bonus to accuracy as your primary weapon.
	* At level 10, you gain access to Level 3 techniques, and gain access to a new chosen Element and its tech tree. You can also choose to get a permanent boost to a secondary attribute:
		Short Accuracy +5%
		Wide Accuracy +5%
		Evasion +5%
		Fire Resistance +10% 
			(Evasion +10% when attacked with Fire element, and chance to receive Burning status effect is reduced by half rounded down, so e.g. a 33% chance would become 16%.)
		Earth Resistance +10%
		Water Resistance +10%
		Air Resistance +10%
	* At level 15, you gain access to Level 4 techniques, and gain access to a new chosen Element and its tech tree. You have become adept in your chosen style of combat, and can choose to get a permanent boost to a secondary attribute:

Only 1 style may be selected and one of the elements in the style chosen must be your favored element. You will gain access to 1 Wide and 1 Short L5 techniques combining the elements from the chosen style. This is a unique set of moves that only your character knows, and that you create with the help of your coach.
		Air + Fire: Inferno Style
		Air + Earth: Poison Style
