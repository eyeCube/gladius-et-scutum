Elemental bending a la Avatar: The Last Airbender. Most people cannot bend, those that can usually only bend one element; you are a rare individual, called a Starborn, who can learn to master all 4 elements, though you start with only one.

The combat is turn-based in the style of Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door, and has a heavy focus on martial arts, including grappling, and the elemental synergy between the 4 natural elements.

The setting is in Bronze Age Rome in the Coliseum, and you are a gladiator fighting in a series of tournaments. Each character's progression is based not on their gear, but on their accumulation of in-game techniques and out-of-game skill as a player.




You can gain Boons which allow you to do something during combat that would normally be illegal (acquiring a temporary weapon, getting a temporary helper combatant, taking a break and healing, using some drugs or eating food (using an item basically), getting a free hit on the enemy, getting to reset your positions to the start of the fight, etc.). These are effectively one-time use "items" that you can call on at any point during the battle. You gain these by fulfilling certain randomized requirements during battles.



Combat plays out like this.
	Both sides select everything they want to do for the round.
	Then the round executes, and is resolved. The Priority stat of techniques, and the speed of the combatants will be factored into determining which moves are executed in which order. Each technique is resolved one after another in a queue. Boons have the highest priority of all possible actions.
	---- Attacks can be blocked with good timing, like Paper Mario. -----
								(This could be problematic)
	The next round begins.


	Actions you can take on your turn:
	
		Technique
		Claim Boon - 1 NRG
		Retrieve Weapon (if you are disarmed) - 1 NRG
			Priority -2
			Chance to succeed: 50 + (Skill*2)% if Combat is Short, 100% if Wide.
		Rest - 3 NRG
			Priority -9
			Restore 3 SP; if you are attacked during this turn, restore only 1 SP.
		Suspend (save game)
		Forfeit




There are two modes of combat: Short (grappling), and Wide (non-grappling combat)

Techniques fall under one of two of the above categories; some techniques can be used in either mode of combat, but most can only be used in their respective category.


Elemental combat

Earth
Water
Fire
Air

Fire is harmed by Water, strenthed by Air, defeats Earth
Air is harmed by Earth, strengthed by Fire, defeats Water
Water is harmed by Air, strengthed by Earth, defeats Fire
Earth is harmed by Fire, strengthed by Water, defeats Air


Fire -> Earth -> Air -> Water -> (Fire)

Status effects:

	Fire techniques can cause _Burn_ (Burning) effect.
		Opponent takes 1 dmg per turn for the duration
		
	Earth techniques can cause _Daze_ (Dazed) effect.
		25% chance that any given action will fail for the duration. 
		
	Air techniques can cause _Gasp_ (Gasping) effect.
		Opponent has -10% to-hit for the duration
		Opponent has -10% Evasion for the duration
		
	Water techniques can cause _Soft_ (Softened) effect.
		Opponent has -1 to Def for the duration
		Opponent has -1 to Speed for the duration
	
	The duration does not count down like a typical turn counter. Instead, each action attempted reduces the duration for all statuses by 1, so taking multiple actions per turn can reduce the duration of the effect significantly compared to taking a single action per turn.
		
	Statuses are not mutually exclusive. You can be Cold and Burning at the same time (that would suck). If a status is applied to a target that already is affected by that status, the status durations stack. There is no limit to how high the duration stack can get.
